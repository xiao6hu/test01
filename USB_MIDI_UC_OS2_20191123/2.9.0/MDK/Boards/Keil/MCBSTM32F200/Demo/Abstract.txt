The 'Demo' project is a demo program for the STM32F207 microcontroller
using Keil 'MCBSTM32F200' Evaluation Board, compliant to Cortex
Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =           25.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =          120.00 MHz

 - Graphical LCD display shows three possible example modes

   Display shows:
    a) - 12-bit AD converter value bargraph depending on potentiometer position
       - State of buttons
       - Joystick directions
       - Touchscreen dependent images
    
    b) - Accelerometer output
       - Gyroscope output

    c) - Digital camera output stream


Press or hold the WAKEUP key to change between example modes.


The Demo program is available for one target:
 - Debug:
   - Compiler optimization Level 1
 - Release:
   - Compiler optimization Level 3


Jumper settings:
  - J17 must be shorted to enable digital camera


Note:
  This Demo example program exceeds MDK-ARM Lite Edition codesize limitation
  and therefore it cannot be rebuild. Prebuild image is available for
  MDK-ARM Lite Edition users: do not try to Build or Rebuild the example,
  just connect the evaluation board, press the Download button and
  example should start running.
