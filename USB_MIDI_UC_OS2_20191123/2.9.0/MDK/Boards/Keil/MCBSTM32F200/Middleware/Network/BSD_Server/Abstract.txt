This program is a BSD_Server example running on Network Dual Stack.
It is used to serve LED control requests received from the client.

In order to run this example, you need to use auto-assigned IPv6 address
or set IPv4 address to match your local area network.

To test this example, run windows application "LEDSwitch.exe" on your PC.
Enter the IP address, server port and select the transfer protocol TCP or UDP.
When you change the value of P2 in windows application, LED diodes on
evaluation board should light accordingly.

The same example can be tested also with BSD_Client running on another
evaluation board. 

The BSD_Server program is a standalone application preconfigured for
MCBSTM32F200 Evaluation Board.

Application is loaded into on-chip flash and is available 
for following targets:
- Debug:
  - Compiler optimization Level 1
  - Debug Network library
  - Enabled Event Recorder
- Release:
  - Compiler optimization Level 3
  - Release Network library

Note:
  - MCBSTM32F200 V1.2: KSZ8081RNA Ethernet PHY is populated.
                       KSZ8081RNA CMSIS-Driver Ethernet PHY is preselected.

  - MCBSTM32F200 V1.1: ST802RT1 Ethernet PHY is populated.
                       Change selection of CMSIS-Driver Ethernet PHY in
                       the Run-Time Environment window to ST802RT1.
