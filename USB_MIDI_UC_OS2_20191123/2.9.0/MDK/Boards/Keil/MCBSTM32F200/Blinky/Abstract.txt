The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
ST 'STM32F207' microcontroller using Keil 'MCBSTM32F200' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =           25.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =          120.00 MHz

 - LEDs are blinking as running light
 - blinking speed depends on potentiometer position
 - blinking is paused while holding down the USER button

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
 - Debug:
   - Compiler optimization Level 1
   - Enabled Event Recorder
   - Keil RTX5 variant 'Source'
 - Release:
   - Compiler optimization Level 3
   - Keil RTX5 variant 'Library'
 - Debug RAM:
   - Compiler optimization Level 1
   - Enabled Event Recorder
   - Keil RTX5 variant 'Source'
   - Runs from internal RAM

   - Flash Options Bytes
 - Release OTP:
   - Compiler optimization Level 3
   - Keil RTX5 variant 'Library'
   - One-Time programmable Bytes
 - Debug ULP:

   - Ulink-Pro and ETM

ULINKpro notes
--------------
STM32F2xx_TP.ini enables synchronous 4bit Trace Interface
ETM Trace pins:  TRACECK         PE2
                 TRACED0..3      PE3..PE6    (4 bit trace data)
                 do not use these pins in your application!

Instruction trace is very time and resource consuming
therefore if you want to use instruction trace use
nothing else (no LA, no exceptions, no ITM, no ...).

Jumper Configuration:
  Set jumpers J10, J11, J12 (close to ETM connector) to position 'Trace'.
